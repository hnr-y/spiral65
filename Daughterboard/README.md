## Introduction
The Unified Daughterboard Project is an open standard to unify the USB daughterboards used in custom mechanical keyboard projects.  
The Unified Daughterboard allows designers to easily implementing electrical protection via a tested proven PCB, and allows users to maintain and repair their keyboards in the future.  
  
For more details on the Unified Daughterboard project, see the [main website](https://unified-daughterboard.github.io/).


## C Series

The C5 daughterboard is the current most recent revision to the classic square form-factor daughterboard, with its roots in the C1 which was designed to be compatible with Wilba's keyboards.
The daughterboard features the following:

- ESD protection, overcurrent protection, overvoltage protection, shielding noise decoupling, and single-path grounding to chassis functionality
- Two variants: The new Molex Pico-EZmate and the classic JST-SH
- 1:1 connector pinout to retain compatibility with existing PCBs
- Same form factor as the older C3 series, allowing for daughterboard upgrades
  
**This is the EZM variant using the Pico-EZMate connector.**  
For background on why two variants exist, please see the [announcement post](https://unified-daughterboard.github.io/#/announcements/announcement-20231022).

The C5 version of the daughterboard was split into two versions: C-JSH and C-PEM, repectively pertaining to versions using the JST-SH connector and the MOLEX EZMate connector.
